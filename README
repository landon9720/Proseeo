this doesn't even wrap git
it's just a collection of command line tools for
  parsing these documents
  updating these documents
  indexing them
  providing querying and reporting services
  later: signing and encryption!!!!
stores these as a plain-text document right on the file system
filenames in the format: guid.proseeo -- it's a directory! inside is the script, and attachments!
an indexer can crawl all these documents to build a reportable index
  using mongo
  but don't checkin the mongo database! no need. :) the tools can
  rebuild when needed
report query language..maybe native mongo queries at first
there needs to be conf files
  ./.proseeo.conf
    users
      listed so that user references can be validated
    groups
      listed for the same reason
    basically anything that might need to be referenced should be configured
    with metadata (name, email address, etc.) which will allow tools
    to annotate those references, send emails, etc.
  ~/.proseeo.conf
    smtp.setting1 =
    smpt.setting2 = etc ... allows tools to send messages on user's behalf

Welcome to Proseeo
Here I am building a platform to help groups get stuff done. This is distributed process structure. DPS.
This is a new way for groups to communicate, to organize, and to get stuff done.
I am starting with business of making software. This is the work I know, and the
first who will use this.

it really has no dependencies on git all all
any source control will do! ha!

going to need it to be an sbt probject
going to need to publish a brew formula
